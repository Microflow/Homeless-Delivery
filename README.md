# Homeless Delivery 

#### An experimental web-app for helping the homeless. This simple web-app was inspired by "Hijacking Amazon Prime for Good". If you haven't seen this vid, please check it out now, by clicking on the picture.

#### When I watched the video, I wondered:

- Do we need to wait for Christmas to set up a system like this?
- Do we need to use Amazon, or can we do it on our own?



## Latest Version

The latest version is [here](https://codepen.io/Teeke/live/XWXqdLN). It's not good enough to show to a wide audience. I need to fix;

- The design. 
- How it looks on mobile. 

## Help Us Trial This Web-App

If you want to help prove the concept of this app, you will need:

- Two people (an asker and a deliverer)
- A Reddit app on a smartphone (we are using Reddit for the prototype as it saves us 30-40 hours of coding time)
- Patience and goodwill. 

## How It Works

### Step One: Ask a Homeless Person What They Need. 

Like in the video, the asker can approach homeless people, and respectfully ask them if they need anything. It's probably not a good idea to offer money... but socks, shoes, food, water, blankets are all good. A small menu may help. 

Right now, the experiments would need to be self funded. But later, when there are more users, we hope the public will donate to the cause on Patreon or Paypal.  

### Step Two: Take a quick video of the asker and the homeless person, with their permission.


Why use a web-app?
