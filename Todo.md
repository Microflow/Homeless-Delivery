## TODO List

- Set up subreddits for Homeless Delivery Test and Homeless Delivery. /r/HomelessDevVerified /r/HomelessDevUnverified.
- Clear up issues. Have one brainstorming issue for random thoughts. 
- Find a restaurant that would deliver to homeless people?
- Get the main web-app up on surge. 
- Get HTML deploy ready. 
- Buy domain.
- Check photo click experience. Does it go to Reddit. Can we embed?
