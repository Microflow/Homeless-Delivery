# Homeless Delivery 

## An experimental web-app for delivering goods quickly to the homeless. 

#### This simple web-app was inspired by "Hijacking Amazon Prime for Good". If you haven't seen this vid, please check it out now, by clicking on the picture.

#### When I watched the video, I wondered:

- Do we need to wait for Christmas to set up a system like this?
- Do we need to use Amazon, or can we do it on our own?

## Latest Version

The latest version is [here](https://codepen.io/Teeke/live/XWXqdLN). It's not good enough to show to a wide audience. I need to fix;

- The design. 
- How it looks on mobile.

# Help Us Trial This Web-App

### If you want to help prove the concept of this app, you will need:

- Two people (an **Asker** and a **Delivery Person**)
- A Reddit app on a smartphone (we are using Reddit for the prototype as it saves us 30-40 hours of coding time)
- Patience and goodwill. 

<br/><br/><br/>

# How It Works

### One: Ask a Homeless Person What They Need. 

Like in the video, the asker can approach homeless people, and respectfully ask them if they need anything. It's probably not a good idea to offer money... but socks, shoes, food, water, blankets are all good. A small menu may help. 

Right now, the experiments would need to be self funded. But later, when there are more users, we hope the public will donate to the cause on Patreon or Paypal.  

### Two: Take a quick video of the asker and the homeless person, with their permission.

In the video, just ask them if they have anything they need long term. Maybe they need a place to stay, or they have skills for a job. 

### Three: Upload the video to /r/HomelessDelivery or /r/HomelessDelivery

Use the following format for the title of the video {NAME} {LOCATION} {WHAT THEY NEED}

Example: Steve @Waterloo Station. Needs 5 pairs of socks, 5 bananas and a loaf of bread. 

Once the video is uploaded, it will appear on the web app within 2-3 minutes. 

### Four: Deliver the goods to the homeless person

When the delivery person sees the name, location and request of the homeless person, they can go and buy the goods needed, and deliver them. It would be helpful if the video gave some exact clues as to the location of the homeless person.

### Five: Take a video of the delivery. 

After the goods are delivered, we want to prove that they arrived. We also want to show that this

# FAQ

### Why use a web-app? Why can't the asker and delivery person communicate by phone, email, or message app?

People need to see something good going on in the world. The news is always telling us how bad we are. Delivering the goods on a public app shows viewers that there are people focused on fixing the world.

### Who will pay?

Later, we hope that experiments like this are funded on StartSomeGood or Patreon. 

### Can I set up a version of this in my local area?

Yes, the source code is free for you tomodify as you like. 

### Who funds the delivery ?

At first, it would have to be a volunteer using 5 pounds of their own money... but if the concept worked... I would hope people could donate on Patreon or StartSomeGood.

### How about the asker finding local businesses who were willing to donate stuff and linking up with the deliverer ?

That's a good idea. We could start with a menu.
